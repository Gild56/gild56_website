# Gild56 Website

The `gild56_website` project is my personal website. You can chat in the community tab or compete in the Gild56's levels top. Subscibe to [my YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@gild56gmd)!

You need to change `app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=5000)` to `app.run(debug=True)` to run it locally.
